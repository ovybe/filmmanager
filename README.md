# Movie Manager
A movie manager I made as a school project. The aim of the project was to show that we know how to use OOP in the development of an app. The teacher told us that we can make something of our own choice and I decided to make a program that manages a list of movies (which can be 2D or 3D).
# How does it work?
It is just the code for now. If you compile and run it you will be mainly able to add, remove and modify movies. You can also look through the list by searching using the name,genre,actor or the movie's ID.
# W.I.P
This was just a small project I did and it still has many issues and lacks many features. 
I might get back to it and work more on it in the future, but for now, nothing new is planned to be added.
Current ideas I had which I would like to add to the program:
 - Filters for name,genre,actor.
 - Rework the menus
 - Clean up the code a little more.
 - Possibly make it more user-friendly.
